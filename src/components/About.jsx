        <p>
            Welcome to my website! Below, you will find a few projects that I have worked on in the past. I am a recent graduate from the University of Illinois, currently seeking full-time opportunities as a Software Engineer. I specialize in building elegant products for the web.

        <p>
            I'm Taiwanese-Canadian, but I lived in Shanghai and Hong Kong for the majority of my life. Outside of work, I'm a professional DJ, and I tinker with cars.
